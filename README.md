Goal of the Project
The goal of this project is to build a Motion and Orientation Tracking System using the Adafruit LSM6DSOX 6-DoF IMU sensor and an Arduino board. The system reads real-time acceleration and gyroscopic data to calculate angular orientation changes and provides outputs that can be used for applications such as tilt detection, motion tracking, and gesture recognition.

By processing the sensor's data, the project demonstrates how to map physical movements into a digital form, enabling a wide range of possibilities in robotics, automotive safety, gaming interfaces, and wearable technology. This project is designed for educational purposes and practical use in motion analysis.
